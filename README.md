# TheLifeLog
A productivity program

The Life Log is a productivity suite filled with many different functions to help the user organize and manage their life. I created this 
project as a Capstone Project for my Bachelor's degree in programming. I've been updating and redoing most of the work from this project to 
see how far my skills in C# have come since April 2021. This program uses C# and WinForms along with an SQL database to run. 

The Life Log contains a user login and seven different categories of functions, each having anywhere from 0-4 subcategories. The dashboard 
also has previews of different categories to give the user a sneak peek into their information. 

Categories:
1. Monthly Calendar
2. To Do Lists
3. Goals
  - Goals
  - Long Term Goals
  - Habits
4. Budget
  - Budget
  - Savings
  - Past Spending
  - Bills
5. Shopping Lists
6. Meal Planning
7. Cleaning
  - Cleaning
  - Last Time I...

Not all categories and subcategories are functional in this project, but the majority of them are. There are also several more ideas that I
want to implement in the future. For now, this project is updated and functional to where I want it to be.
